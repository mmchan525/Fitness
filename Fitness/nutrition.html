                <p> Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel. </p>
                <p> Don't approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal. </p>
                <p> Portion your mealsand track your calories. There are many free mobile apps avaliabel to help track your activity level and calories. </p>
                <p> Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week. </p>

                <p> Use the following as a guideline: </p>
                	<ul>
                		<li> Protein, such as eggs, chicken and lean red meat </li>
                		<li> Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas </li>
                		<li> Fruit </li>
                		<li> Fat, such as olive oil, nuts and seeds </li>
                	</ul>

                	<p> Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes and processed foods. These foods are high in carbohydrates. </p>
                	<p> When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour and flax seeds. </p>
